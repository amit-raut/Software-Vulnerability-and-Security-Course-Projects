The design of the test harness:
    I created a fuzz and fuzz22 python program which takes the initial config value 
    i.e. a random 32 bit int value as input. It also takes the pdf file as input

Input Generation Strategy:
    I created 2 approaches for generating the deterministic input
    1. Using the md5 hash of the initial config value
        a. I created the md5 hash of the initial config value using python hashlib
        b. The 32 char md5 hash value is then xored with the bytes of the original pdf file
        c. I looped through the blocks in the original pdf file array
        d. Finally the newly generated array is passed as an input to the pdftotext
        
    2. Using the seed with random.seed
        a. I generated the random.seed value for the initial config value
        b. Based on the seed value other values are created in a deterministic manner
        c. Finally the changed array of the input is fed to pdfto text 
        
Crieteria Used for Clustering:
    As I found only a single patter in crashing of pdftotext program all the initial config 
    values are clustered in single cluster of Segmentation faults
    
Bugs Found:
    I found the segmentation fault which crashed the pdftotext program with exit status of -11.
    The exit status of -11 for pdftotext caused the core dumped for the pdftotext program.
    This bug is exploitable as it caused complete crash of the program.
    
    Some of the other bugs ended up in giving error code of 99 or 1. This does not generated any core dump files.
    I also found the other handled exeptions for pdftotext. 

Bugs triggering:
    The bugs whcih ended up in segfault was the only one produced with the fuzzing.
