########### Malware Classification And Triage ##########


Features extracted from the sample set:

    I used following procedure to extract the features from the malware samples
    
    1. Extracted strace for all malware samples using the straceExtractor python
        script
        
    2. From the strace files obtained extracted overlapping set of n consecutive 
        system calls
        
    3. Generated universal feature set containing 28148 entries each with n gram
        method ( 5 consecutive system calls i.e. n = 5)
        
    4. Finally created unique feature set which contained 431 entries
        
    The feature set generated with the above procedure is very effective as it is 
    extracted from the overlapping system calls from the strace. 
    
    
The Feature Hashing strategy Used:

    I used SHA1 hashing algorithm to hash the each feature. After feature hashing 
    I generated the distance matrix of dimention 824 x 431. The distance matrix 
    containing pairwise Jaccard distance for all samples was generated using 
    function in allFeatureScript. Finally using scipy created generated 
    dendrogram (file named 'clusterToGenerateDendrogram')
    
The Crieteria Used to Choose Cluster Set:

    I used scipy library to cluster the samples. The scipy library requires a 
    distance matrix as input. I fed scipy linkage function the distance vector 
    matrix of dimentation 824 x 824 which gave me the cluster set which can be 
    used to plot dendrogram.
    
    To generate the cluster json file I created cluster script which takes 
    configuration file as input. The output generated by the cluster script maps
    the malware samples in terms of 431 unique families. The file named clusters.json 
    in the repo shows the clustering of the malware samples in 431 families. 
    Some features are very common in all malware samples which can be removed. 
    The feature shared among all malware samples can be safely considered benign 
    (like feature 0 in this case).
