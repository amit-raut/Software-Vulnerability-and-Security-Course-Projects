Vulnerability:
	The vulnerability in the given C program is because use of unsafe code (strcpy function). 
	This vulnerability causes the buffer to be overflowned beyond its legal bounds.
	In execution of the program the process_verify() function contains the unsafe code.


Exploit:
	For the successful exploit I calculate the frame length (0xe8) and return address (0x7fffffff850) and 
	then overflow the buffer with the explit.py script. After that I ended up in the bash command mode. 
	Now I was able to access the files which permission was denied.

Exploit mitigation:
	To mitigate the exploit I can use safer version of the strcpy() i.e. strncpy(). 
	Also if the length of the given hash value is not equal to buffer length then I safly show eror message.


Trivial code reuse attack:
	I exploited the vulnerability and get access to the bash shell. After that I can use the same code and 
	reuse with different parameters it to get in to another bash shell. 
	If we could do this over and over again we could possibly crash the system containing the buffer overflow vulnerability
