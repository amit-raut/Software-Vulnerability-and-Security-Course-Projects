In an attempt to perform the exploit for the prset04, I created a python script named "exploit.py".

I initially ran the prset04 binary using port 9999 which puts the binary in the listening mode.
I tried to overflow the read buffer present in the binary code with more than 1048 bytes of data.
I overwritten the return address for the OnClient() function with the address which will point to the 
gadget sequence.

Gadget Sequence: To create gadget sequence I used the tool called ropeme which is capable of finding the 
gadget sequence and exploit payload. The tool is not available on the virtual envirnoment hence I was not able
to get the gadget sequence for the binary file.

As the binary is protected with DEP (Data Execution Prevention) the external payload can't not be executed 
directly. Instead we use the gadget sequence which contains the calls to libc.so.6. 

Beating ASLR: In order to beat the ASLR protection on the binary file I found addresses to the fixed libc.so.6
system calls. I found 2 address; one of which points to the first libc.so.6 function call generated by the binary
using "grep libc /proc/[$pid for prset04]/maps" command and the second points to system call which can be found using 
"nm -D /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep '\<system\>'" command. Alternatively ASLR can be beaten by using 
bruteforcing over 2^28 possibilities.

The successful exploit will allow an attacker to run shell prompt on the system. The attacker will have root level
access to the system as the binary file is owned by the root user.
